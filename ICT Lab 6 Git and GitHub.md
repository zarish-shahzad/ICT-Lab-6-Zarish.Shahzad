Short Note on Git and GitHub:
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in files and coordinate work on projects among multiple people.

GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git repositories, allowing collaboration, version tracking, and sharing of projects.

Git helps in maintaining the history of code, rolling back changes if needed, and managing multiple branches of a project.

GitHub allows developers to work together, review code, and manage projects efficiently.
